# Data-Analysis-in-Python
In this project, I tackled a real-world dataset and applied various data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights. 

Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy are used to manipulate the data and Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to create insightful visualizations. 

Concepts which I learnt during the project - 

-> Importing Python libraries

-> Reading the csv file in Jupyter Notebook for analysis

-> Automated Data Cleaning and Data Transformation

-> Dataframes

-> Dictionary and Tuples
